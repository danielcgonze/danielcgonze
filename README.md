# Hi there, I'm Dani

**`Learning Full Stack Web Development`**

I am taking the first steps as a Junior Web Developer. Currently, I am completing my training and working on personal projects.
I have a special interest in frontend development and UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) design. I want to combine my previous knowledge in communication and audiovisual storytelling with the interactive possibilities offered by web development.
